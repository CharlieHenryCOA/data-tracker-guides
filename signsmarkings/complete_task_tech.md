#  Complete a Work Task

**User Role Required**: Technician

1. Follow the steps in [Find Tasks](https://github.com/cityofaustin/data-tracker-guides/blob/master/signsmarkings/find_tasks_tech.md) to view the **Task Details** page.

    The **Task Details** page displays relevant information about the work task, as well as forms to submit information about work that was completed.

2. Scroll down the page to find tables for Time, Specifications, and Materials. There is a form below each table which will allow you to submit entries for each section of the work task. 

    **Note**: The task entry forms will only be displayed if the task has status of **ISSUED** and if the user's role is **Technician**.

3. To add an entry for any section of the **Task Details**, complete the form fields in the section, then click the blue button to submit the form. A green confirmation message will confirm that the entry was successfully submitted, and a new row will display in that section's entry table.

5. To complete the work task, click the **Complete Task** button at the top of the **Task Details** page.  From the confirmation window that appears, click the blue **Complete Task** button to mark the task as completed.
