## About User Accounts

In order to create user accounts or modify user roles, a user must be desiginated as an **Account Administrator**. Contact your workgroup's system administrator for information about account administration.

Signs & Markings users are assigned one of three roles: Viewer, Technician, or Supervisor. The below table summarizes which actions are permitted by each role.
